            <h2>AI-Powered Scouting Is Reshaping How Teams Evaluate Talent</h2>
            <p class="date">January 15, 2026</p>

            <p>Scouting is no longer limited to highlight tapes and in-person evaluations. Platforms like Hudl and Stats Perform are using AI and computer vision to automatically break down game film, track player movements, and generate performance metrics at scale. Hudl’s tools can tag plays, identify formations, and evaluate player decision-making without requiring hours of manual video review. (HUDL) As a user of Hudl myself, it was extremely useful in the recruiting process and I wouldn’t have committed without it.</p>

            <p>What makes this significant is the accessibility. AI-driven scouting tools are now used by high school, college, and professional teams, leveling the playing field for programs without massive recruiting budgets. Coaches can quickly search film by situation, compare athletes across games, and focus more time on strategic evaluation instead of film organization.</p>

            <p>This shift fits into a broader trend of sports data. AI allows teams to evaluate more athletes in more detail, reducing reliance on reputation or limited exposure. It also opens the door for overlooked players to be discovered based on performance metrics rather than name recognition alone.</p>

            <p>I find this exciting because it changes how opportunity works in sports. Talent evaluation becomes more objective, and players who consistently perform well can stand out even if they aren’t at powerhouse programs.</p>
