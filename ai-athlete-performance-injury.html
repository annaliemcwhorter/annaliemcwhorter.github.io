            <h2>How AI Is Changing Athlete Performance and Injury Prevention</h2>
            <p class="date">January 15, 2026</p>

            <p>Catapult, a leading sports performance analytics company, continues to expand how AI is used to monitor athlete workload and reduce injury risk across professional and collegiate sports. Teams using Catapult wearables collect real data such as speed, acceleration, player load, and movement patterns during practices and games. (Catapult Sports) What’s new is how machine learning models are being applied to this data to flag fatigue trends and injury risk before problems show up on the field or in the gym.</p>

            <p>Instead of relying solely on coaches’ intuition, Catapult’s AI analyzes thousands of data points per athlete and compares them against historical performance baselines. This allows performance staff to adjust training loads, recovery plans, and practice intensity on a more individualized level. For high-level programs, this can mean fewer soft-tissue injuries and more consistent athlete availability throughout a season.</p>

            <p>This matters because injuries are one of the biggest competitive and financial risks in sports. AI-driven load management reflects a larger trend toward data-backed decision-making replacing guesswork. It also highlights how AI is becoming normalized in day-to-day sports operations, not just elite professional teams but increasingly at the college level as well. (SBJ Tech)</p>

            <p>From my perspective, this is one of the most practical and impactful uses of AI in sports. As someone who has trained through injuries before, the idea that data can help prevent them rather than just react to them feels like a major step forward.</p>
