        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>This newsletter explores how applied artificial intelligence is transforming sports. I focus on areas like athlete performance, injury prevention, scouting, analytics, and fan experience. I’m passionate about this topic because I’ve been playing sports—volleyball and beach volleyball—since a very young age. Now playing college beach volleyball, I have firsthand experience with training, injuries, recruitment, and watching sports, which helps me understand the practical impact AI can have in athletics.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Annalie McWhorter, and I’m a junior at Lindenwood University. I play college beach volleyball and am majoring in Social Media Marketing. I’m interested in sports marketing, traveling, and design, and I’m excited to explore how AI is shaping the future of sports through this newsletter.</p>
